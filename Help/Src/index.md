# osFotoFix

Yet another tool to manage pictures. The initial idea is simple: All new pictures came from a source directory.
You can move or copy the good one to the destination in a directory build from the pictures date in this format:<br/>
[Year]/[Year_]___[Month]<br/>
Each picture is also renamed like this:<br/>
[Year][Month][Day]___[Houre][Minute][Secound]___[Kennung].[Extension]

The ugly pictures can moved to the trash directory or can deleted permanetly.

## Development

I'm an C++ developer for realtime process control systems. And i have some tools wirtten in C#, so im not an absolut beginner.
But this is my first open source project. It is only for my private use and to teach myself in C# development under Linux.

And excue me for my englich. I don't wirte in englich very often.
