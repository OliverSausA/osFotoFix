# osFotoFix

Yet another tool to manage pictures. The initial idea is simple: All new pictures came from a source directory.
You can move or copy the good ones to the destination in a directory, build from the pictures date in this format:

     [Year]/[Year]_[Month]

Each picture is also renamed like this:

     [Year][Month][Day]_[Houre][Minute][Secound]_[Kennung].[Extension]

The ugly pictures can moved to the trash directory or can deleted permanetly.
